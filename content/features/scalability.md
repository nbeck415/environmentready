In order for ephemeral environments to be a productive and worthwhile tool for your organization, they won't accumulate any unreasonable costs or consume excess resources.

## Cloud elasticity
- ephemeral environments are an elastic way for you to use the cloud for your organization
- you're not forced to wait for resources to free up in order to access your environments  
- because of virtualization, your environments can scale up and down, depending on how many resources they may require at any given moment

## Cost cutting
- using scalable ephemeral environments will keep your costs at bay, as computing resources are dynamically allocated based on the load required
- in terms of cloud costs, your organization will only pay for the cloud resources they use
- ephemeral environments are easily spun up and destroyed, which means they only need to last as long as your team may need them

## Resource constraints
- when you're not using the cloud in an elastic way, your team will run into roadblocks
- without cloud elasticity, teams will be waiting until computing resources free up before they can host their environments
- statically-allocated computing resources will incur unnecessary costs when underused, but limit performance on busier days

## Break things, don't block things
- ephemeral environments are intrinsically isolated environments
- by keeping your environments isolated, they can run independently of each other
- decoupling your dependencies will prevent your environments from breaking other environments
- isolated environments allow each member to test features independently without worrying about blocking other team members if anything goes awry
