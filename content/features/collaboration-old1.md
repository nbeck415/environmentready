A major benefit of ephemeral environments is how convenient they make sharing and collaborating across your team.

## Cross-Team Communications
Since ephemeral environments are lightweight and easily shareable, they simplify cross-team communications, resulting in a faster, smoother dev pipeline.

### Developer-Developer
During code reviews, developers may need to tear down their local environments in order to build another dev's environment. With ephemeral environments, developers can run the code and feature branches entirely in an environment without destroying their local environment.

### Developer-Product
When developers create a feature, they'll want to run it past someone on the product team. This can be done through a call or screenshare, however that won't allow the product team member to interact with the app. With ephemeral environments, developers can send the product person a direct link to the WIP environment and gather relevant, full-scope feedback.

### Developer-QA
After a feature passes a code review, QA can immediately interact with the new feature and provide feedback. This allows QA to find problems and bugs early on, prior to a merge, so the devs can quickly address and fix accordingly.

### Developer-Customer
If a customer has a certain app in mind and requests a demo, developers can build a sample app and send them a link to a live ephemeral environment. This way, customers can interact with their app and get a sense of its appearance and approximate performance.
